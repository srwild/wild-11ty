# A Basic Eleventy Starter ðŸŽˆ

Eleventy is amazing. I like it very much. Combined with Netlify, it makes web development fun and approachable for perpetual n00bs like me.

There are many ways to setup an Eleventy site. Itâ€™s not opinionated and itâ€™s made by nice people. This is just simplified version of how I do it for all the sites Iâ€™ve built recently. Most of them were originally in Jekyll, another good Static Site Generator (SSG). Ugh, I still have to do one thatâ€™s in WordPress.

## Getting Started

`git clone`

`cd `

`npm install` to get everything installed

## Usage

`npm start` for local development.* Site is served at `http://localhost:8080/`.

*Uses the development environment variable so you can hide or show things for local development, such as Googoo Analytics (yuck).

```
{% if project.environment == "development" %}
  <!-- Show me in development environments -->
{% else %}
  <!-- Show me in other environments or if one isn't set -->
{% endif %}
```

`npm run debug` for figuring out whatâ€™s wrong. Usually something dumb I did, like bad speeling.

`npm run performance` gives you a lot of information on what Eleventy is doing.

`npm run build` builds your awesome site. This is what Netlify will use when they* build your site. Itâ€™s set in `netlify.toml`

*I always picture someone at Netlify getting a message from a pneumatic tube that I want to deploy a site. A bell rings. That message gets handed off to many people. Then my code goes down an assembly line.

NOTE: Sass is kind of wonky. The sourcemaps donâ€™t work. Plus, in the `npm start` script I have it run before concurrently because Eleventy doesnâ€™t pull it in when it starts up. Does that make sense? I makes sense to me how it doesnâ€™t make sense. Anyway, it works it doesnâ€™t mess anything up.

I donâ€™t expect anyone will use this, but if you have any questions or comments, please file an issue.
