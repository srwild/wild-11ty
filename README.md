# A Basic Eleventy Starter ðŸŽˆ

Eleventy is amazing and made by nice people. I like it very much. Combined with Netlify, it makes web development fun and approachable for perpetual n00bs like me.

There are many ways to setup an Eleventy site. Iâ€™ve read many tutorials and blog posts, where Iâ€™ve picked up bits and pieces that made sense to me and the way I work. This is just simplified version of how I do it for all the sites Iâ€™ve built recently. Some of them were originally in Jekyll, another good Static Site Generator (SSG). I still have to do one thatâ€™s in WordPress, which might be a bit more difficult to switch from.

## Getting Started

`git clone https://github.com/srwild/wild-11ty.git`

`cd wild-11ty`

`npm install` to get everything installed

## Usage

`npm start` for local development.* Site is served at `http://localhost:8080/`.

*Uses the development environment variable so you can hide or show things for local development, such as analytics and other things you donâ€™t need locally. 

```
{% if project.environment == "development" %}
  <!-- Show me in development environments -->
{% else %}
  <!-- Show me in other environments or if one isn't set -->
{% endif %}
```

NOTE: Sass is kind of wonky. The sourcemaps donâ€™t work (paths are wrong). In the `npm start` script I have it run before concurrently because Eleventy doesnâ€™t pull it in when it starts up. I also have a `clean` script that removes the `_site` and compiled `CSS` so when you rerun it thereâ€™s no `CSS` file. Does that make sense? Probably not. It makes sense to me how it doesnâ€™t make sense. Anyway, it works and it doesnâ€™t mess anything up.

`npm run debug` for figuring out whatâ€™s wrong. Usually something dumb I did, like bad speeling.

`npm run performance` gives you a lot of information on what Eleventy is doing.

`npm run build` builds your awesome site. This is what Netlify will use when they* build your site. Itâ€™s set in `netlify.toml`

*I always picture someone at Netlify getting a message from a pneumatic tube that I want to deploy a site. A bell rings. That message gets handed off to many people. Then my code goes down an assembly line.
